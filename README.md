## My process
- I first downloaded the starter files and created a local repository with it. 
- I created an empty repository on my Github and connected it to my local repository.
- I added the Google Font, Outfit on the header and finished the rest of the html.
- With the css, I first aligned the div to the center using Flexbox. 
- I styled the rest of the HTML elements while using the Figma file for the details.
- I rechecked the similarity and added the small details. 

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Using link tag to add a font from Google Font
```html
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

```

- Using Flexbox to center align div horizontally and vertically
```css
body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-content: center;
}
```

-Using Box Shadow and its 4 values
```css
div {
    box-shadow: 0 1px 5px hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm gonna keep on working on HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. I'll also do the other challenges about landing pages and with JavaScript functions.
